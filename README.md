# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first time using github.
I'm just a dude from America living in Japan.
I've grown up loving computers have done a little programming in the past.
For some reason I never got too deep into it.  When things got too hard, I would quit.
But now I have a new found motivation.  I want to learn more about programming and I want to improve my art.
I know can become a wonderful web designer! Maybe I'll do some more Back-End Development as well.
Anyway, it's nice to meet everyone! Let's all do our best and accomplish our goals together!
