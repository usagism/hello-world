# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first time using github.
I'm just a dude from America living in Japan.
I've grown up loving computers have done a little programming in the past.
Maybe I'll do some more Back-End Development as well.
Anyway, it's nice to meet everyone! Let's all do our best and accomplish our goals together!

I've become much better at programming! 
I've learned c#,various frameworks of javascript, and even learned some back-end programming.
I've been looking at making some small games using Unreal Engine.  
It'll be time consuming, but should be a fun little project.

If I can make flappy, bird how hard could it be to make a simple Platformer???

Taking some of the focus of games for a little bit, to focus more on Web Development. Strong focus on Back-End Programming.
I've been looking into working on projects that make use of Vue.JS on the Front End, and Node.JS on the Back-End.  However, I have started looking into using Laravel. I'm not too familar with PHP, but the Laravel framework is very easy to follow. I've had a lot of trouble getting Databases to work with MySQL. It's mostly just software issuse, rather than programming. But it's a little frustrating. The protocols needed just to call localhost on MAC OS is crazy. So much security.   Looking into moving over to Linux, just for the experience.
